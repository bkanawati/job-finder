# job-finder
An application that seeks available jobs listed from two providers (GitHub and Search.gov)

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?search=&location=DUBAI' from origin'http://127.0.0.1:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
As of now I use a chrome extension to enable CORS.
